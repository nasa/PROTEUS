## Installation

### Download the Source Code
Download the source code and change working directory to cloned repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nasa/PROTEUS.git
cd PROTEUS
```

### Standard Installation
Install dependencies (installation via conda is recommended):
```bash
conda install --file docker/requirements.txt
conda install -c conda-forge --file docker/requirements.txt.forge
```

Install via setup.py:

```bash
python setup.py install
python setup.py clean
```

Note: Installation via pip is not currently recommended due to an
issue with the osgeo and gdal dependency.


OR update environment path to run PROTEUS:

```bash
export PROTEUS_HOME=$PWD
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${PROTEUS_HOME}/src
export PATH=${PATH}:${PROTEUS_HOME}/bin
```

Run workflow tests to ensure proper installation:

```bash
pytest -rpP tests
```

Process data sets; use a runconfig file to specify the location
of the dataset, the output directory, parameters, etc.

```bash
dswx_hls.py <path to runconfig file>
```

A default runconfig file can be found: `PROTEUS > src > proteus > defaults > dswx_hls.yaml`.
This file can be copied and modified for your needs.
Note: The runconfig must meet this schema: `PROTEUS > src > proteus > schemas > dswx_hls.yaml`.


### Alternate Installation: Docker Image

Skip the standard installation process above.

Then, from inside the cloned repository, build the Docker image:
(This will automatically run the workflow tests.)

```bash
./build_docker_image.sh
```

Load the Docker container image onto your computer:

```bash
docker load -i docker/dockerimg_proteus_cal_val_3.1.tar
```

See DSWx-HLS Science Algorithm Software (SAS) User Guide for instructions on processing via Docker.
